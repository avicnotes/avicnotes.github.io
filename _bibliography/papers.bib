  title={Heterogeneous Beliefs, Risk Amplification, and Asset Returns},
  author={Goutham, Gopalakrishna and Seung Joo, Lee and Theofanis, Papamichalis},
  abstract={How do heterogeneous beliefs about growth prospects affect the macroeconomyâ€™s endogenous volatility and transition dynamics? We first set out a tractable framework that incorporates heterogeneous beliefs about technological growth, and assess their impact on the amplification of risks during crises. When productive experts become more optimistic about their growth prospects, trade is facilitated, raising investment, asset prices, and leverage ratio considerably. However, when the economy transitions into a crisis, belief heterogeneity exacerbates aggregate risk, resulting in excess volatility and higher risk-premium. The economy ends up spending a longer time in crises on average. Finally, our model generates the excess conditional asset return momentum which is empirically observed during crises and raises the pricing power in the cross-section of asset returns significantly, beyond the conventional factors proposed by the literature.},

  title={ALIENs and Continuous Time Economies},
  author={Goutham, Gopalakrishna},
  abstract={I develop a new computational framework called Actively Learned and Informed Equilibrium Nets (ALIENs) to solve continuous time economic models with endogenous state variables and highly non-linear policy functions. I employ neural networks that are trained to solve supervised learning problems that respect the laws governed by the economic system in the form of general parabolic partial differential equations. The economic information is encoded as regularizers that disciplines the deep neural network in the learning process. The sub-domain of the high dimensional state space that carries the most economic information is learned actively in an iterative loop, enforcing the random training points to be sampled from areas that matter the most to ensure convergence. I utilize a state-of-the art distributed framework to train the network that speeds up computation time significantly. The method is applied to successfully solve a model of macro-finance that is notoriously difficult to handle using traditional finite difference schemes.},

  title={Intermediaries with something to lose: On the origins and consequences of bank failures (Draft available upon request)},
  author={Goutham, Gopalakrishna},
  abstract={This paper builds a macro-finance model with endogenous bankruptcy of intermediaries to analyze the dynamics of financial crises. The model features leveraged intermediaries who face stochastic costs to intermediate assets, and possess franchise value that they lose upon bankruptcy, trapping the economy in states of economic distress with slow recovery. The model quantitatively predicts a large risk premium, low GDP growth, and high bank failures during financial crisis. Analyzing a panel of Bank Holding Companies, I offer empirical evidence for the franchise value to be associated with a higher probability of failure. The results indicate that the changing scope of banking industry with declining franchise value compared to the pre-crisis period is worrisome, despite strong capital ratios.},
