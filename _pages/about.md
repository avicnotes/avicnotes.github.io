I am a PhD candidate at `École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne` and the `Swiss Finance Institute`. My research interests are in macro-finance, machine Learning, and asset pricing. I received the **2021 CESifo Distinguished Affiliate** award, was a runner-up for the **ESRB Ieke van den Burg Prize 2021**, and received the PhD grant at **20th Macro-Finance Society Workshop**.

> I will be a visiting assistant professor at the Bendheim Center for Finance at Princeton University in the Fall of 2023.

> **New**: The course materials for my mini-course on Deep-Learning and Macro-Finance taught at Princeton University is available [here](https://bcf.princeton.edu/events/mini-lecture-deep-learning-and-macrofinance/).

I worked as a quantitative researcher for four years prior to my graduate studies. My hobbies are playing basketball, weight training, traveling, and solving math and algorithmic puzzles.
